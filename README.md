# My GTK4 & Python Examples

## Description
You can find here some examples for Python3 + GTK 4. These are things where I had to do quite a bit research or to deep dive in the documentation to get proper information. Sadly, the documentation is rare and there are only a few examples for Python out there, or if they are there, they are mostly utter rubbish and probably for GTK 3. I hope my repository helps to reduce the amount of time spent on looking up the documentation of GTK 4. <3

## List of my GTK 4, Python Examples
- [Dialog.md Response Listeners for MessageBoxes using ResponseType & Dialogs](Dialog.md)
- [Icons.md add App Icon (taskbar) and issues helper](Icons.md)
- [WindowCloseEvent.md - How to handle windows close-request and prevent the Event from destroying the Window?](WindowCloseEvent.md)

# My GTK4 & Python Examples

## Description
You can find here some examples for Python3 + GTK 4. I had to do quite a bit research to find the elements from the list below. Mostly, it was a deep-dive into the docs, their Gitlab and StackOverflow.

Sadly, the documentation is rare and there are only a few examples for Python out there, or if they are there, they are mostly utter rubbish and probably for GTK 3.

I hope my repository helps you to drastically reduce time for searching and reading docs. <3

## List of my GTK 4, Python Examples
- [Response Listeners for MessageBoxes using ResponseType & Gtk.Dialog](Dialog.md)
